# Python_learning
- Mini projects from studying Python in Courcera.org.
- Will add my mini-projects while stidying Python in course "An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python (Part 1)"
- All projects were created with CodeSculptor
>CodeSkulptor is an interactive, web-based Python programming environment that allows Python code to be run in a web browser. The application was developed by Scott Rixner, a professor of computer science at Rice University.[1] Its features include visualization of program execution; the ability to conveniently store, edit, and share code online with other users; and cogent error messages that are helpful for debugging code.

- CodeSkulptor implements three custom modules for graphics in the browser, each with an easy-to-learn interface. The SimpleGUI module is for building interactive programs and drawing. The SimpleMap module is for drawing features on maps. The SimplePlot module is for plotting numeric data. To use these operations, first import the appropriate module with import simplegui, import simplemap, or import simpleplot.
