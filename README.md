# Python_learning
- Mini projects from studying Python in Courcera.org.
- Will add my mini-projects while stidying Python in course "An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python (Part 1)"
- All projects were created with CodeSculptor
>CodeSkulptor is an interactive, web-based Python programming environment that allows Python code to be run in a web browser. The application was developed by Scott Rixner, a professor of computer science at Rice University.[1] Its features include visualization of program execution; the ability to conveniently store, edit, and share code online with other users; and cogent error messages that are helpful for debugging code.
